# Construction_Supplier
Software Specification and Design Course Term Project


In this course we try to create an software for the one real construction supplier company for the course project purposes.We have to do client meeting and interview to determine the problems and to find a solutions to them.So basicly we did an requirement analysis.After that we have to define the problems in the system and determine the functional and non-functional requirements of our projects.Then we draw the context model, data fow diagram, activity diagrams of the functional requirements, use case diagrams, use case text to show the basic flow of events and the alternative flow of events, class diagrams and etc...

For this project we didn't implement any code however we design graphical user interfaces to for the software.
